# EmailSpamFilter
 The goal of this project is to develop an effective email spam filter specifically tailored for advertisement emails. Utilizing your own email account, primarily focusing on platforms such as Gmail due to its extensive spam collection, you will gather examples of spam emails to construct and train the spam filter.
